          <h1>This page is about flowers.</h1>

          <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
            structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms).
            The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually
             by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.</p>

          <p>Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population)
          resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower)
           when self pollination occurs.</p>

          <p>In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants,
            flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment,
            and also as objects of romance, ritual, religion, medicine and as a source of food.</p>
